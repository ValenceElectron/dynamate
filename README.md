# Overview

Dynamate is a graphics engine for building small, 2D graphics applications that run in transparent windows!

Using GLFW, Dynamate instantiates a transparent window with no decorations and draws onto it using OpenGL. This allows you to
decorate your desktop space with whatever kind of animated scene that you'd like!
